# 🧠 SkillCraft Technology – Data Science Task 02  
**📌 Project:** Exploratory Data Analysis on Nobel Prize Dataset   
**📍 Dataset Source:** Kaggle - Nobel Prize Dataset

---

## 🔍 What I Did:
- Cleaned and explored Nobel Prize data using Python (Colab).
- Visualized data using bar charts, histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
- Identified trends, relationships, and insights across gender, age, categories, and time.
- Investigated country-wise distribution and organizational affiliations.

## 📊 Key Insights:

1. **🏆 Most Awarded Fields:**  
   - Physics and Medicine have received the highest number of awards.

2. **👩‍🔬 Gender Representation:**  
   - Around 90% of Nobel laureates are male.  
   - Female representation is increasing slowly, especially in Peace and Literature.

3. **🌍 Country of Origin:**  
   - USA leads with the highest number of Nobel Prize winners.  
   - UK, Germany, and France follow closely.

4. **🏫 Top Institutions:**  
   - Harvard, MIT, and Stanford have the most affiliations with Nobel laureates.

5. **📈 Temporal Patterns:**  
   - Post-1950, there's a surge in Nobel awards, especially in science categories.  
   - Recent years show more diversity in winners’ nationalities.

6. **🧒 Age Distribution:**  
   - Most winners are aged between 55 and 65.  
   - The youngest laureate was just 17 (Malala Yousafzai – Peace Prize).  
   - Age distributions vary significantly by category.

7. **📚 Category Trends Over Time:**  
   - Peace and Literature prizes are more evenly distributed across countries.  
   - Science categories are more dominated by Western countries.

8. **👬 Multiple Winners:**  
   - Some categories frequently have shared prizes among 2–3 recipients.  
   - Common in Peace, Chemistry, and Medicine.
